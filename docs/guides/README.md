# Guides

Welcome! These guides will help you get started with your project and develop effectively.

## Getting Started

Everyone starts here, regardless of how you prefer to work:

1. **[Create Your Project](01-create-your-project.md)** - Create a new repository from this template
2. **[Setup Your Environment](02-setup-environment.md)** - Clone, open in VS Code, and start developing

## Choose Your Path

Once your environment is running, choose the workflow that fits you best:

### AI-First Development

**Best for:** Creators who want to build with AI assistance, or anyone who prefers describing what they want over typing commands.

With Claude Code, you describe what you want in plain English and Claude handles the implementation. You can create features, fix bugs, run tests, and manage git - all through conversation.

### Hands-On Development

**Best for:** Developers who want full control, prefer running commands directly, or want to understand what's happening under the hood.

These guides cover the development tools, commands, and workflows available in this starterkit.

## Can I Use Both?

Absolutely! Many developers use AI-first for rapid prototyping and hands-on when they need precise control. The guides complement each other - feel free to explore both.
