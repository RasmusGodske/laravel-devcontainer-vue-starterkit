# Create Your Project

This guide walks you through creating your own project using this starterkit as a template.

## What You'll Get

When you create a project from this template, you get:

- **A complete copy** of all the code, tools, and configuration
- **Your own repository** with a fresh git history
- **Full ownership** - the code is yours to modify, deploy, and control however you want

Unlike platforms that host your code for you, this gives you complete independence. Your project lives in your GitHub account, and you can take it anywhere.

## Prerequisites

You'll need a **GitHub account**. If you don't have one:

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Follow the steps to create your free account

## Step 1: Create Your Repository

Click this link to create your project:

**[Create Your Project from Template](https://github.com/new?template_name=laravel-devcontainer-vue-starterkit&template_owner=RasmusGodske)**

This opens GitHub's "Create a new repository" page with the template pre-selected.

## Step 2: Fill In Your Project Details

On the repository creation page:

1. **Repository name**: Choose a name for your project (e.g., `my-awesome-app`)
   - Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
   - This will be part of your project's URL

2. **Description** (optional): A short description of what you're building

3. **Public or Private**:
   - **Public**: Anyone can see your code (good for open source)
   - **Private**: Only you (and people you invite) can see it

4. Click the green **"Create repository"** button

## Step 3: Done!

GitHub will create your new repository. You now have your own copy of the starterkit.

Your repository URL will be: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-PROJECT-NAME`

## Next Steps

Now that your repository exists, you need to set up your development environment:
